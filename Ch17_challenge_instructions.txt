1. Write a regular expression that matches the word "Dutch" in The Zen of Python poem

Answer: $ grep Dutch zen.txt

2. Come up with a regular expression that matches all the digits in the string: Arizona, 479, 501, 870. California, 209, 213, 650.

Solution: first I created an environmental variable (x) with the string. Then -->
	echo $x | grep [[:digit:]]

3. Create a regular expression that matches any word that starts with any character and is followed by 2 o's. (Ex. Too look book bread face soon goon island)

Solution: created a regular expression for "Too look book bread face soon goon island" as 'y'. Then issued command: echo $y | grep -o .oo 
				which matched a word starting with any char followed by 				"oo"

3a. Then use Python's "re module" to match "boo" and "loo" in a sentence "The ghost that says boo haunts the loo". (See Ch17_3a for solution)
